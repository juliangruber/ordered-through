# ordered-through

Through stream that applies async functions to chunks and emits them in order,
no matter how long each operation takes.

## Usage

```js
var through = require('ordered-through');

var ordered = through(function (chunk, cb) {
  // some async function
  setTimeout(function () {
    // emit transformed data
    cb(null, 'Chunk: ' + chunk);
  }, Math.random() * 100);
});

ordered.on('data', console.log);

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) ordered.write(i);
ordered.end();
```

output:

```
Chunk: 0
Chunk: 1
Chunk: 2
Chunk: 3
Chunk: 4
Chunk: 5
Chunk: 6
Chunk: 7
Chunk: 8
Chunk: 9
```

## API

### OrderedThrough(fn)

Calls `fn` with every chunk that gets written to it and a callback function
that you need to call with `err` and `chunk` for every chunk you transformed.
